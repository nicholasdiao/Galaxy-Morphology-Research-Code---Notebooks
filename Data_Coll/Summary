Data Collection and Processing

These three files are what I used to begin my research process at the Carnegie Institution For Science. 
I investigated the structure of middle-mass galaxies. 
I began by combining UVISTA catalog into a central catalog for galaxies in our mass regime. 
Then I pulled images of these galaxies from the NASA IRSA server. 
Then I connected the images to the UVISTA data, and deleted rows without images.
