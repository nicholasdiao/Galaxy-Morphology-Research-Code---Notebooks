# Galaxy_Morphology_Research__iPythonNotebooks
Note this work is released for collaborative purposes, for any astronomers interested in the research of galaxy morphology. 
The following code is what I used to collect and analyze data from the UVISTA catalog and HST images. The galaxies examined were all in a mass regime of 10^9 and 10^10 solar masses. The fitting process of galaxy models was accomplished using the GALFIT code. 
The end result investigated the relation between star formation rates and galaxy structure.
